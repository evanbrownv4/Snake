TO DO:

    Queue instructions:
        - Find a way to prevent you from inputting 3 moves at once, and then only using the last one
        - Probably create a FIFO stack of inputs, consecutive similar inputs would be turned into just 1
        - A move would be entered on a valid key input, a move would be taken out every frame/iteration of the run loop

    Currently you cant travel access the squares on the border of the playspace, fix that soon

    Style points:
        - Special image for the head of the snake
        - Create a grid of dark and less dark green squares for better perception of size/position

        - Make game over screen less ugly
