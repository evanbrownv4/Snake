TO DO:

Use variables for stuff like screen resolution and do calculations with these variables

Queue instructions:
    - Find a way to prevent you from inputting 3 moves at once, and then only using the last one
    - Probably create a FIFO stack of inputs, consecutive similar inputs would be turned into just 1
    - A move would be entered on a valid key input, a move would be taken out every frame/iteration of the run loop

Style points:
    - Special image for the head of the snake
    - Create a grid of dark and less dark green squares for better perception of size/position
